*****ARGUMENTS******
 *
 * arg0:	Number of agents. Changing this will crash the program.
 * 		Default: 2
 * 
 * arg1: 	Delay of agents, in MS.
 * 		Default: 1000
 * 
 * arg2: 	Percept length, in terms of whole notes.
 * 		Eg. 1 will make the percept length 1 whole note
 * 		Default: 1
 * 
 * arg3: 	Lagging length coefficient: Lagging length = Percept length * lagging length coefficient.
 * 		Lagging length is how far behind an agent needs to be to be considered lagging.
 * 		A larger value means that an agent is more likely going to have to make
 * 		decisions only on their perception, but blocks the other agents less.
 * 		Default: 0.25
 * 
 * arg4: 	BPM
 * 		Default: 100
 * 
 * arg5: 	Bass duration probabilities (comma delimited), from whole note to 16th note.
 * 		Default: 0.1,0.1,0.7,0.1,0
 * 
 * arg6:	Tenor duration probabilities (comma delimited), from whole note to 16th note.
 * 		Default: 0.05,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.05
 * 
 * arg7:	Alto duration probabilities (comma delimited), from whole note to 16th note.
 * 		Default: 0.05,0.1,0.4,0.4,0.05
 * 
 * arg8:	Soprano duration probabilities (comma delimited), from whole note to 16th note.
 * 		Default: 0,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.2
 * 
 * arg9:	Sounding probabilities (probabilities of what type of sounding an agent chooses)
 * 		In the form of perfect consonance probability, imperfect consonance probability,
 * 		mild dissonance probability, sharp dissonance probability.
 * 		Default: 0.04,0.9,0.04,0.02
 * 
 * arg10: 	Whether to accept user input (open the user input window)
 * 		Default: true
 * 
 * arg11: 	Whether to use GUI (true means use GUI)
 * 		Default: true
 * 
 * arg12:	Type of GUI to display (NOTATION, MIDISCORE, or SKETCH)
 * 		Default: MIDISCORE
